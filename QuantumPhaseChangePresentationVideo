Presentation Video link. This is my presentation on the phenomenon known as Quantum Phase Transitions or Quantum Phase Change and it's relevance in today's society of quantum computing or discrete mathematics. In this presentation, I cover the origins and evidence of quantum phase changes along with some experimental theories. I also explain how Quantum Phase Changes work and its use in many systems that we utilize today. Finally I also explain the relevance of Quantum Phase Change in quantum computing and discrete mathematics as a whole.
